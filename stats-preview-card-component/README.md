## Overview

My solution to the Stats preview card without access to the design doc.

## My process

- Reviewed the style-guide and mockup images
- Created html and css files, then added root section with style guide elements to CSS file
- Formatted HTML using Flexbox
- Filled in default and standardized CSS attributes to img, h2, and p elements
- Worked on image overlay for interactive image
- Launched page and begin adjusting margin, padding and border until I was happy with the look for the desktop view
- Repeated last step for mobile view and wrapped up with tweaks to the scale of the container on widths between media screens

I would note for this one that the font sizing took me some time, I need to not be such a stickler for pixel perfect mockup matches, especially when I do not have access to the design doc. As long as it looks close enough to the mockup, the stakeholder would ultimately be happy with the result.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned that while I am not an expert at CSS, I am still retaining what I'm learning through practice. I was able to set up the image overlay without referring to an external resource (win)!
