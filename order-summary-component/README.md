## My process

- Reviewed the style-guide and mockup images
- Created html and css files, then added root section with style guide elements to CSS file
- Formatted HTML using Flexbox
- Filled in default and standardized CSS attributes to img, h2, and p elements
- Worked on image overlay for interactive image
- Launched page and begin adjusting margin, padding and border until I was happy with the look for the desktop view
- Repeated last step for mobile view and wrapped up with tweaks to the scale of the container on widths between media screens

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned more about positioning background during this project. I'd like to spend more time mastering positioning and the background shorthand to consolidate lines of code.

### Continued development

See above.
